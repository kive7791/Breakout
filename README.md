# Breakout
This repository contains a modified version of the Breakout project from ATLS4140. The updates include changes to the visuals, font, drawings, and bricks.

## New Features
### Story Board Drawings
### Gameplay Enhancements 
1. Game Over and Continuation: The game will now stop after you lose 3 lives. However, you can continue playing by clicking the screen.
2. Red Block Interaction: When you hit a red block, two balls will be in play. The second ball is a decoy, so stay focused on the real one.
3. Camera Shake Effect: The camera will shake each time a brick is hit, adding to the visual impact of the game.

### Video Showcase
A short video is available to demonstrate the new features and capabilities of the game. Please refer to the separate file for this video.
